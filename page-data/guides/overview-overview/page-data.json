What are the skills you need to develop to reach Staff Engineer?\nAre technical abilities alone sufficient to achieve and succeed in that role?\nHow do most folks move into this role?\nWhat is your manager's role in helping you along the way?\nWill you enjoy being a Staff Engineer, or will you toil for years to achieve a role that doesn't suit you?</p>\n<p>In my engineering management career, I've developed an increasingly clear point of view on\nanswering those questions around the Staff Engineer role,\nbut my perspectives are shaped by my own experiences, and I believe it's important\nto go beyond boldly presenting my beliefs as universal truths.\nIn writing <em>Staff Engineer</em>, I interviewed more than a dozen Staff-plus engineers across the industry\nabout their lived experiences, and have folded their experiences into my own to create\nsomething richer in nuance, breadth, and perspective than I could have ever written on my own.</p>\n<p>If you're already in a Staff-plus role, I hope these writings will energize you in your\njourney as a leader outside the management track. If you aim for such a role, I hope\nthey will provide a pragmatic aid in its pursuit.\nThis book can be read cover to cover, but depending on which of those best describe you, feel jump to the sections that sound most interesting.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong><a href=\"/guides/overview-overview\">Overview</a></strong> - a survey of the Staff Engineer role, how it varies by company, and why the title matters</li>\n<li><strong><a href=\"/guides/operating-at-staff\">Operating at Staff</a></strong> - how to do  the work on the other side of the title</li>\n<li><strong><a href=\"/guides/getting-the-title-where-you-are\">Getting the title where you are</a></strong> - how to attain a Staff-plus role at your current company</li>\n<li><strong><a href=\"/guides/deciding-to-switch\">Switching companies to get the title</a></strong> - when and how changing companies can support the pursuit of a Staff-plus title</li>\n<li><strong><a href=\"/guides/stories\">Stories</a></strong> - collected stories from Staff-plus engineers about what they do and how they reached their role</li>\n<li><strong><a href=\"/guides/learning-materials\">Resources</a></strong> - a collection of templates and further readings if you're looking for more</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Every company puts its own spin on Staff-plus roles, so it's likely that some parts won't map to your experience.\nIf that's the case, please take what resonates and discard what doesn't!</p>","frontmatter":{"date":"June 21, 2020","slug":"/guides/overview-overview","name":null,"role":null,"kind":"guide","title":"Introduction"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/guides/overview-overview"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2249418449","2906657295","762788943"]}
