Hearing dozens of folks share their map\n\n\n      to a Staff-plus role should be\n      far more useful than what any one person has seen at their company.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      The StaffEng project is focused on collecting folks' stories of reaching Staff-plus roles\n\n\n      and succeeding once they're there.\n    </p>\n\n    <h3>Sharing your story</h3>\n\n    <p>\n      <em>\n        Questions?
