  I’m a Senior Staff Software Engineer at Split.io, working on the backend of what we call the COE team.  Split is a feature flagging and experimentation framework.  We focus on enabling our customers to separate deployment and release in CI/CD and also enabling A/B testing.  My team is responsible for most of the main business logic of our web application, including everything from data storage to the APIs.  There is a separate team that focuses on the experimentation side, including all of the detailed statistics that goes into that, so we’re able to focus more on the main platform.

<p>
  I’m still somewhat new, so I’m still working to define my role, which is part of the beauty of more senior roles.  Today, I’m still ramping up, so I’m probably spending around half to three quarters of my time on tasks for my specific scrum team, just like any other engineer here.  With the rest of my time, I’m participating in conversations and working with other engineers to define a lot of our longer term architecture and strategy, including our future API and platform strategy, how we want to develop our authorization framework, breaking up and decoupling our builds and more.  I’ve recently also taken over leadership of our backend chapter and now co-lead it with another engineer and we’re working to put together a backend technical vision, prioritize tech projects and lead standards discussions.  If that wasn’t enough, I also continue to write regularly on my blog and speak at conferences.

  I'm a Staff Engineer at Squarespace. Squarespace is the leading all-in-one platform to build a beautiful online presence: websites, domains, online stores, marketing tools, scheduling appointments, etc. I also operate as the Team Lead of the Internationalization Platform team, which is responsible for building and maintaining the foundational primitives of internationalization across Squarespace products. Engineers use the tools and libraries we own to create localized products.
</p>
<p>
  <strong><em>What does a Staff-plus engineer do at Squarespace? How do you spend your time?</em></strong>
</p>
<p>
  I think in practice the day-to-day responsibilities of Staff-plus engineers vary, depending on both your precise role and how your responsibilities map in the organization.
</p>
<p>
  My position as a Team Lead means I'm fully accountable for the output of my team, both from a business and technical perspective. On the business side, I spend a lot of time meeting with different teams and functions across the company. These stakeholders include product, strategy, customer operations, etc. I want to ensure that I have as many inputs as possible to validate that my team's roadmap reflects our company's most important priorities.
</p>
<p>
  On the technical side, I often find myself reviewing technical documents or scoping work in front of a whiteboard for my team's work in flight. My role has evolved to less hands on coding work and more asking probing questions about architectural decisions and deployment strategies. One irony is that as a Staff Engineer I actually code significantly less than I did as a non-Staff. By no means is that universally true across the role, but in the context of my team, closing vim and operating in more of a strategic/oversight role was the highest leverage use of my time. I’m lucky in that my team is already composed of awesome engineers so my specific code contributions are less material to our output.
</p>
<p>
  But many Staff-plus engineers at Squarespace are not Team Leads and code a lot. Others focus on engineering process and culture. In general I'd say Staff-plus Engineer responsibilities are highly contextual.

  I was most recently at Stripe. They do online payment processing, and it’s a pretty fast growing startup of about two thousand people. Engineering was around six hundred. When I left, I technically didn't have a title. If I had stayed another two months, I would have been a Staff Engineer, because they finally rolled out titles after some years of internal debate.
</p>
<p>
  The team I worked on most recently was called Payment Architecture, which was a team of three or four fairly senior engineers. Payments are the core of Stripe’s product, and we looked after the payments codebase. We were particularly focused on the financial infrastructure layers of the codebase, and building the data model and abstractions we needed to support all of Stripe’s current and aspirational product lines.
</p>
<p>
  We looked at how code structure fits into organizational structure, including how to structure code within a rapidly growing organization that was adding teams, products, countries, and payments methods. It was particularly important that our architecture support spreading ownership across a number of offices and timezones.
</p>
<p>
  We drove a lot of initiatives around code quality and code architecture, and did some implementation and rewrite projects. For each of those initiatives, we developed metrics and goals, got teams to take on those goals, and then gave teams tools to help them migrate to the new standards.

I'm a senior principal engineer at <a href="https://www.fastly.com/">Fastly</a>. Fastly is an edge cloud platform that provides services like a CDN. I work in OCTO, the Office of the CTO, which is composed of about ten principal or distinguished engineers who report directly to the CTO. Each member of OCTO tends to have their own focus, and mine is being the API Lead.
</p>
<p>
<strong><em>What does a Staff-plus engineer do at your company? How do you spend your time?</em></strong>
</p>
<p>
There are several quite different types of principal and distinguished engineers in OCTO. There are also principal engineers that work within engineering teams directly, rather than within OCTO. In the OCTO group, some work on internet standards or academic research, some do deep technical research and prototyping, some help incubate a team building something completely new. I'm closely involved with the broader engineering organization in my API Lead role.
</p>
<p>
We all work on different things, but we have a common goal of taking a holistic, long-term and system-wide view on things. We also try to find and help with the sort of things across engineering that might get overlooked or fall between the cracks. Our CTO supports our work, but doesn't identify the projects to work on, that's up to us.
</p>
<p>
I've never thought about my time in terms of percentages. Some of my work goes in phases, with more of one thing this week, more of that the next. A massive amount of my time is spent doing written work, research, and talking to people. I'll have regular meetings with the teams and managers that build APIs. I'll spend time breaking a long-term strategy into little chunks, doing research, and writing a proposal on that. Then I'll have to market that proposal around the company. Less on writing code lately, but in other phases I'll build demos or tooling to support the wider work. That coding work is still really enjoyable.

  I’m a Staff Engineer at Dropbox. I actually was a Staff Engineer at Dropbox, left to join a different startup, and then recently came back to Dropbox just a few months ago. I came back because a really interesting opportunity opened up within Dropbox to launch an internal incubator. We’re working to foster innovation within the company. Dropbox has become a strong brand in the file sync space, but there’s beginning to be a lot of competition there now, so we need to do more and branch out into new products. The incubator works directly with the CEO, and is a very small team.
</p>
<p>
  I’d been at Dropbox long enough that I built really close bonds with a lot of people here, so when folks pitched me this role it sounded really fun. I’d also been a manager for a couple of years and was getting a little itchy to code again. Putting those together led me back to Dropbox.
</p>
<p>
  There are two parts to the incubator.
</p>
v<p>
  The first is a more classic incubator where engineers across the company can pitch ideas and get funding to join the program, and try to show product-market fit or other forms of progress to continue getting funded every few months. The goal is for successful projects to graduate into their own lines of business, although we’re still early.
</p>
<p>
  The second part is engineers who are permanently part of the incubator, and are always generating ideas from within the incubator and operating with a lot of autonomy. I’m one of the two engineers on that permanent “scouting” team, and we’re planning on growing over the next year. It’s very different from anything I’ve done before, which is why I wanted to sign up for it. It’s a huge paradigm shift for me. Honestly, the first few months have been a combination of really fun and really frustrating because it’s harder to measure obvious impact when your primary goal is to very quickly try out a ton of new ideas, many of which will not go anywhere. I’ve had to learn to think of impact in longer timescales - not in terms of what I’m shipping today, but what I could influence the company to ship in the future,
</p>
<p>
  <strong><em>What does a Staff-plus engineer do at your company?</em></strong>
</p>
<p>
  I'd say there are two different profiles of Staff Engineer at Dropbox. One is a tech lead who does a lot of coordination, designs work for their team, and spends time driving projects. The other is more of a specialist.
</p>
<p>
  The tech lead was definitely my profile when I initially became Staff where I took a team of about eight engineers and drove an eighteen month project. That project had a lot of dependencies, a lot of gnarly parts. I had to control the communication around the project, as well as figure out how to allocate pieces of the project to the team in a way that both helped them grow and got the project done.
</p>
<p>
  The specialist is deeply specialized in a particular area, for example <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guido_van_Rossum">Guido van Rossum</a>, the creator of Python. Specialists would take on really complex projects and execute it themselves, often projects that no one else could take on effectively. There were fewer specialists than tech leads.
