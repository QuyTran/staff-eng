At most technology companies, you'll reach Senior Software Engineer, the [career level](https://lethain.com/mailbag-beyond-career-level/),
in five to eight years. At that point your path branches, and you have the opportunity to pursue engineering management or continue down
the path of technical excellence to become a Staff Engineer (or whatever other term your company decides to use).

Over the past few years we've seen a flurry of books unlocking the engineering manager career path, like
Camille Fournier's [The Manager's Path](https://www.amazon.com/Managers-Path-Leaders-Navigating-Growth/dp/1491973897),
Julie Zhuo's [The Making of a Manager](https://www.amazon.com/Making-Manager-What-Everyone-Looks/dp/0735219567/),
Lara Hogan's [Resilient Management](https://resilient-management.com)
and my own [An Elegant Puzzle](https://www.amazon.com/Elegant-Puzzle-Systems-Engineering-Management/dp/1732265186).
The management career isn't an easy one, but increasingly there are maps available for navigating it,
and at least some of those maps will help you navigate it in a way that's authentic for you.

On the other hand, the transition into Staff Engineer, and its further evolutions like Distinguished Engineer,
remains challenging and undocumented. What are the skills you need to develop to reach Staff Engineer?
Are technical abilities alone sufficient to reach and succeed in that role?
How do most folks reach this role?
What is your manager's role in helping you along the way?
Will you enjoy being a Staff Engineer or toil for years to achieve a role that doesn't suit you?

While I wanted to provide answers to each of those questions, I wanted to go beyond boldly
presenting my beliefs as universal truth.
(If you want my unsubstantiated leadership advice, that's what my previous book is for.
Instead I started with interviewing more than a dozen Staff-plus engineers about their experiences,
and folded that into something richer in experience, nuance and perspective than I could have ever written on my own.

Those recommendations are grouped into five sections:

*   **Overview** - survey of your career, the Staff Engineer role, and why the title matters
*   **Operating at Staff** - how to do  the work on the other side of the title
*   **Getting the title where you are** - how to attain a Staff-plus role at your current company
*   **Switching companies to get the title** - when and how changing companies can support attaining a Staff-plus title
*   **Resources** - collection of templates and further readings if you’re looking for more

As a final admission, my career has been centered in companies that follow some version of the Silicon Valley playbook,
and I’m certain some facets of this advice won’t resonate as strongly if your company eschews those patterns.
Increasingly the patterns set in Silicon Valley echo into the broader ecosystem, but sometimes these notes travel slowly.
If some aspects don’t resonate with your circumstances, I’d be the first to suggest they may not apply in your circumstances.
