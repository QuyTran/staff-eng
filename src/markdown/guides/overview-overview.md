At most technology companies, you'll reach Senior Software Engineer, the [career level](https://lethain.com/mailbag-beyond-career-level/)
for software engineers, in five to eight years.
At that level, your company's career ladder won't require you to work towards the next promotion,
and being promoted beyond it is exceptional rather than expected.
At that point, your career path will branch, and you have to decide between
remaining at your current level,
continuing down the path of technical excellence to become a Staff Engineer,
or switching into engineering management.
Of course, the specific titles vary by company, and you can replace
"Senior Engineer" and "Staff Engineer"
with whatever your company prefers.

Over the past few years, we've seen a flurry of books unlocking the engineering management career path, like
Camille Fournier's [The Manager's Path](https://www.amazon.com/Managers-Path-Leaders-Navigating-Growth/dp/1491973897),
Julie Zhuo's [The Making of a Manager](https://www.amazon.com/Making-Manager-What-Everyone-Looks/dp/0735219567/),
Lara Hogan's [Resilient Management](https://resilient-management.com)
and my own [An Elegant Puzzle](https://www.amazon.com/Elegant-Puzzle-Systems-Engineering-Management/dp/1732265186).
The management career isn't an easy one, but increasingly there are maps available for navigating it.

On the other hand, the transition into Staff Engineer, and its further evolutions like
Principal and Distinguished Engineer
remains challenging and undocumented. What are the skills you need to develop to reach Staff Engineer?
Are technical abilities alone sufficient to achieve and succeed in that role?
How do most folks move into this role?
What is your manager's role in helping you along the way?
Will you enjoy being a Staff Engineer, or will you toil for years to achieve a role that doesn't suit you?

In my engineering management career, I've developed an increasingly clear point of view on
answering those questions around the Staff Engineer role,
but my perspectives are shaped by my own experiences, and I believe it's important
to go beyond boldly presenting my beliefs as universal truths.
In writing *Staff Engineer*, I interviewed more than a dozen Staff-plus engineers across the industry
about their lived experiences, and have folded their experiences into my own to create
something richer in nuance, breadth, and perspective than I could have ever written on my own.

If you're already in a Staff-plus role, I hope these writings will energize you in your
journey as a leader outside the management track. If you aim for such a role, I hope
they will provide a pragmatic aid in its pursuit.
This book can be read cover to cover, but depending on which of those best describe you, feel jump to the sections that sound most interesting.

*   **[Overview](/guides/overview-overview)** - a survey of the Staff Engineer role, how it varies by company, and why the title matters
*   **[Operating at Staff](/guides/operating-at-staff)** - how to do  the work on the other side of the title
*   **[Getting the title where you are](/guides/getting-the-title-where-you-are)** - how to attain a Staff-plus role at your current company
*   **[Switching companies to get the title](/guides/deciding-to-switch)** - when and how changing companies can support the pursuit of a Staff-plus title
*   **[Stories](/guides/stories)** - collected stories from Staff-plus engineers about what they do and how they reached their role
*   **[Resources](/guides/learning-materials)** - a collection of templates and further readings if you're looking for more

Every company puts its own spin on Staff-plus roles, so it's likely that some parts won't map to your experience.
If that's the case, please take what resonates and discard what doesn't!
