> One of the best pieces of advice that someone gave me, and that I make sure to pass on to other staff engineers, is that there's a misconception that you become a Staff Engineer and then you’ll be in control of the work you do, and everyone will listen to you and do what you want them to do. That's absolutely the opposite of what happens! You have this really tangible goal of getting a promotion for so long, and then you become a Staff Engineer, and all of a sudden, everything is vague and ambiguous. You transition from solving somewhat clear-cut problems, to being responsible for finding the right problems, and then figuring out how to convince people that it’s important to solve them.

Many engineers become focused on the Staff-plus career path because the engineering manager path has too many meetings or requires too much collaboration with other coworkers… and woah are you going to be surprised if you begin a Staff-plus with that mindset. Although Staff Engineer roles are generally positioned as the sequential step beyond Senior Engineer, it’s genuinely a different role and you’ll increasingly spend your time doing sorts of work that you previously did infrequently or not-at-all.


There is a significant learning-curve in Staff-plus roles that initially trips most folks up.
Part of the challenge is that much of the  work you're doing has a much slower feedback cycle.
The delayed feedback can initially feel quite demoralizing as you replace the visceral coding [REPL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Read–eval–print_loop) with the uneven progress of mentorship, relationship building, and strategy.

This chapter is about overcoming that learning-curve,
learning to operate as a Staff Engineer, and
finding the parts of the role which are personally fulfilling and organizationally transformative.


## Topics

In the interviews for this book, as well as my own experience leading and coaching Staff-plus engineers, a handful of topics kept coming up as keystones of personal development. They aren’t _everything_ you’ll do in the role, but they are the places where you’re most likely to have an outsized impact or accidentally commit a career-limiting move.


1. **[Stay aligned with authority](https://staffeng.com/guides/staying-aligned-with-authority)** to remain an effective leader over time.
2. **[To lead, you have to follow](https://staffeng.com/guides/to-lead-follow)**. Having a vivid sense of how things ought to work
    is a powerful leadership tool, but it's also essential to learn to blend your vision with the visions from your peers and leadership.
3. **[Learn to never be wrong](https://staffeng.com/guides/learn-to-never-be-wrong)** and you can spend less time cleaning up mistakes
    and more time having an impact. Comes with the added benefit of fewer folks complaining about you to your manager.
4. **[Create space for others](https://staffeng.com/guides/create-space-for-others)** so that your team grows stronger than your contribution.
5. **[Build a network of peers](https://staffeng.com/guides/network-of-peers)** to vet difficult decisions, and to give you
    honest feedback when your role's authority starts to temper feedback.
6. **[Work on what matters](https://staffeng.com/guides/work-on-what-matters)** to make the most of the working hours you have,
    particularly as you get further along in your career and life's commitments expand.
7. **[Writing an engineering strategy](/guides/engineering-strategy)** to guide your organization’s approach to supporting your company’s business objectives with its architecture, technology selection, and organizational structure.
8. **[Curating technical quality](/guides/manage-technical-quality)** to maintain the quality of your company’s architecture and software as it grows and tacks over time.


As you deliberately practice in each of these areas, you’ll slowly progress from the newly minted Staff Engineer towards the trusted organizational leadership. That said, these won’t cover everything you do. At times you’ll find your role surprisingly similar to that of an Engineering Director, and at other times strangely familiar to previous work in your career.

That extraordinarily broad remit is part of what makes describing these roles challenging, and if there’s a particular topic you’re focused on that’s missing, check out the [Additional resources for learning](https://staffeng.com/guides/learning-materials) appendix.
