</p>

<h3>Why?</h3>

<p>
  At most technology companies, you'll reach Senior Software Engineer,
  the <a href="https://lethain.com/mailbag-beyond-career-level/">career level</a>,
  in five to eight years. At that point your path branches, and you have the
  opportunity to pursue engineering management or continue down the path of
  technical excellence to become a Staff Engineer.
</p>
<p>
  Over the past few years we've seen a flurry of books unlocking the engineering manager
  career path, like Camille Fournier's
  <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Managers-Path-Leaders-Navigating-Growth/dp/1491973897">The Manager's Path</a>,
  Julie Zhuo's <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Making-Manager-What-Everyone-Looks/dp/0735219567/">The Making of a Manager</a>
  and my own <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Making-Manager-What-Everyone-Looks/dp/0735219567/">An Elegant Puzzle</a>.
  The management career isn't an easy one, but increasingly there is a map available.
</p>
<p>
  The transition into Staff Engineer, and its further evolutions like Principal Engineer,
  remains particularly challenging and undocumented. What are the skills you need to develop to reach Staff Engineer?
  What skills do you need to succeed <em>after</em> you've reached it?  
  How do most folks reach this role? What can companies do to streamline the path to Staff Engineer?
  Will you <em>enjoy</em> being a Staff Engineer or toil for years for a role that doesn't suit you?
</p>
<h3>What?</h3>
<p>
  The <strong>StaffEng</strong> project aims to collect the stories of folks who are operating in Staff,
  Principal or Distinguished Engineer roles. How did you get there? What were your lucky breaks?
  How did you learn to be effective?
</p>
<p>
  These stories will establish role models for folks hoping to become Staff Engineers.
  Further, the "metadata" around these stories will help create
  transparency into the most effective ways to navigate this career path.
</p>
<p>
  Finally, I hope to use those learnings to craft a small number of resources to
  help draft their own map to Staff Engineer. What should you do in the first ninety days
  as a Staff Engineer? What are the highest leverage activities? What should you stop doing?
  What are the resources you can rely upon?
  Hopefully we can provide good resources for all of this.
</p>


<h3>When?</h3>
<p>
  I'm actively collecting stories now, <a href="/share">share yours</a>!
</p>

<h3>Want to help?</h3>
<p>
  If this is something that you're passionate about and
  willing to invest one to two hundred hours into over the
  next one to two years, there is a lot of work to do here
  and I'd love to have one or two full partners in figuring out
  how to support folks in their career development and success
  as Staff Engineers.
