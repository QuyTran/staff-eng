<h2 class="lead">Staff Engineer</h2>
<h4 class="quiet">Getting the title and thriving once youâ€™re there</h4>

<p><em>I'm writing this guide slowly over time. Early drafts will be posted on <a href="https://lethain.com/">lethain.com</a> if you're looking for updates. - Will</em></p>

<p>
  At most technology companies, you'll reach Senior Software Engineer, the <a href="https://lethain.com/mailbag-beyond-career-level/">career level</a>, in five to eight years. At that point your path branches, and you have the opportunity to pursue engineering management or continue down the path of technical excellence to become a Staff Engineer.

<p>
  Over the past few years we've seen a flurry of books unlocking the engineering manager career path, like Camille Fournier's <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Managers-Path-Leaders-Navigating-Growth/dp/1491973897">The Manager's Path</a>, Julie Zhuo's <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Making-Manager-What-Everyone-Looks/dp/0735219567/">The Making of a Manager</a> and my own <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Elegant-Puzzle-Systems-Engineering-Management/dp/1732265186">An Elegant Puzzle</a>. The management career isn't an easy one, but increasingly there is a map available for navigating it.

<p>
  There isn't yet an equivalent set of resources for becoming a Staff Enginere,
  and this guide hopes to provide a map for becoming and succeeding at Staff.
